- CSV file output in `run`
    - This could help a lot with debugging the springer case. I don't know what's going on at the moment.
    - `write_csv_header(sys, csv_filename)`
    - `write_csv_row(sys, csv_filename)`
        - Calculate flow rates for the current time step in there.
- testing
    - `lbf_per_in_const`
- documentation
- pneumatic validation case
    - Use genetic algorithm to better fit the data.
- test each `rc` code for `run`
    - Test if correct `sys` is output (old or new)
- `config_type`
    - `id` for CSV file name
    - whether to enable CSV output or not
- function to calculate efficiency
- Input file reader generator

- gnuplot subroutine for testing and generic output
- water vapor
    - moran_thermodynamics_2008 pp. 666--667: can use $h_g(T)$, $u_g(T)$, or could use Table A-22 (but recognize that Table A-22 has a different datum than the steam tables and can not be used when liquid water is present, which is irrelevant here)
    - Have function to construct `y` given relative humidity.
    - How to handle water condensing out of the air is not clear at the moment, but I suppose I can ignore that to start. All I should have to do to handle water vapor is add the right `gas_type`.
    - This is more complicated than I originally thought: Relative humidity from weather data is given at atmospheric conditions, not pressurized conditions. This means that as the air is compressed, the relative humidity decreases because the vapor pressure increases. So I need to model the compression process. Take ambient air at given relative humidity, and increase the pressure.
- Property test to compare BlasterSim derivatives against numerical derivatives of BlasterSim input.
    - test_fmad.f90: `test_num_deriv`
- Readd `smooth_min` assertions including new one from Wikipedia including some extra gap for floating point error
- Functions to calculate input PE (spring and adiabatic compression) for efficiency calculation.
- Add elevation angle
- Add assertion for validity of lumped parameter approximation
- transonic corrections in the barrel
- pressure gradient
- Instead of `p_atm` in the force balance, allow for using another control volume's pressure.
- exterior ballistics
- Error messages:
    - When mass goes negative, suggest that perhaps their effective area is too large.
- At termination, print:
    - If a success, say so.
    - If a failure, say so.
    - Muzzle velocity including units.
    - efficiency
- Make subroutine to fit `sys%con(:, :)%a_e`, `sys%con(:, :)%b`, `sys%cv(:)%p_fs`, `sys%cv(:)%p_fd` for all `con_types` and `cv_types`.
