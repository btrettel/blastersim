# The `build` module (debug.f90 or release.f90, depending on the value of the `BUILD` make macro) disables assertions. Because this violates this program's assumption that the filename matches that of the module name (`build` is not the same as `debug` or `release`), I had to add some logic to this program to handle this case. Part of that includes ignoring the following files and manually adding a file with the filename `$(BUILD)` later.
