- v0.1.0
    - `check_sys`
        - Total energy and mass are within a tolerance.
            - Derivatives of total mass and energy should be effectively zero.
        - All state variables don't exceed certain amounts.
            - Also check derivatives in stability checks.

    - `write_csv_row`
        - Calculate flow rates for the current time step in there. Alternatively use `m_dot_eff = delta_m/dt` so that the outputs appear to satisfy conservation? Backing out `h_dot_eff` like that would be difficult due to the work term so perhaps don't bother with that approach.
        - Write each component of energy and total energy so that someone can create their own energy balance plots.
    - Order-of-accuracy test for single control volume
        - adiabatic test without atmospheric pressure and friction
            - Can test the following: `x_dot`, `e`, `e_f`
            - `m` is constant
        - constant pressure test with atmospheric pressure and friction
            - seigel_theory_1965 eq. 3-2 is a simpler version of this (just subtract atmospheric and friction pressures from the pressure to factor those in)
            - Can test the following: `x`, `x_dot`, `e_f`
    - Check that derivatives are correct in special cases where something is set to zero with no derivatives. Check for "TODO: Not sure the derivatives of this should be zero."

        - Input checks:
            - Any diameter is too large or too small to not only make sure that it's physically possible, but also that they use the correct units. Perhaps allow the latter to be disabled with `suggestions = .false.`.

            - Simulation isn't worthwhile because it takes less time to figure things out experimentally. Not true from my perspective. In practice, the alternative to simulation has been speculation. People spend a huge amount of time working on things that a simulation could show is not plausible. That's a waste of time. If anything, simulation saves time by reducing the amount of experiments that need to be done. Simulation and experimentation are complementary.
            - How do I calculate optimal barrel length?
                - Comment on some common formulas, give better approximate formulas based on adiabatic process relations, and say how to do it in BlasterSim.

        - API
            - `i_cv_mirror = 0` disables mirror CVs; use for constant volume chambers
        - Write Fortran code to output gas data table to put in documentation.
            - Can I use similar code generation to get other important values from the code?
    - Create subroutines in io.f90 to create different types of CVs. Use these in the tests.
    - At termination, print:
        - If a success, say so.
        - If a failure, say so.
        - Muzzle velocity including units.
        - efficiency
        - whether under- or over-barreled
    - Upload Windows BlasterSim to malware scanner to check. 
    - Check that Windows BlasterSim works in Wine to make sure it doesn't require extra libraries.
    - Stopping criteria based on acceleration to find optimal barrel length
    - Plunger head motion bounds (lower and upper)
        - Lower is not necessarily zero.

- Functions to calculate input PE (spring and adiabatic compression) for efficiency calculation.
- function to calculate efficiency
- gnuplot subroutine for testing and generic output
- water vapor
    - moran_thermodynamics_2008 pp. 666--667: can use $h_g(T)$, $u_g(T)$, or could use Table A-22 (but recognize that Table A-22 has a different datum than the steam tables and can not be used when liquid water is present, which is irrelevant here)
    - Have function to construct `y` given relative humidity.
    - How to handle water condensing out of the air is not clear at the moment, but I suppose I can ignore that to start. All I should have to do to handle water vapor is add the right `gas_type`.
    - This is more complicated than I originally thought: Relative humidity from weather data is given at atmospheric conditions, not pressurized conditions. This means that as the air is compressed, the relative humidity decreases because the vapor pressure increases. So I need to model the compression process. Take ambient air at given relative humidity, and increase the pressure.
- Property test to compare BlasterSim derivatives against numerical derivatives of BlasterSim input.
    - test_fmad.f90: `test_num_deriv`
- Readd `smooth_min` assertions including new one from Wikipedia including some extra gap for floating point error
- Add elevation angle
- Add assertion for validity of lumped parameter approximation
- transonic corrections in the barrel
- pressure gradient
    - Is the pressure gradient necessary? The multiple control volumes will provide a pressure gradient of sorts.
- exterior ballistics
- Error messages:
    - When mass or temperature goes negative, suggest that perhaps the effective area is too large.
- Make subroutine to fit `sys%con(:, :)%a_e`, `sys%con(:, :)%b`, `sys%cv(:)%p_fs`, `sys%cv(:)%p_fd` for all `con_types` and `cv_types`.
- Valve opening time, valve poppet model using pressures from CVs
- test each `status%rc` code for `check_sys`
- Test if correct `sys` is output for `run` (old or new)
- Data to collect from the open literature:
    - sudden contraction data for $A_\text{e}$ and $b$ would be useful for springers
- Have ability to run multiple cycles and terminate when mass gets low in any particular CV.
- If I use a constant pressure/temperature CV to model a HPA or CO2 tank, then I'll still need a way to estimate the real gas internal energy and enthalpy. Going all the way with a better equation of state and thermodynamic properties might not be much more complex. I could make each control volume use a different EOS if I want to avoid iterations associated with a different EOS.
- Arbitrary displacement vs. force curves, using cubic splines for smoothness
- Why is there a small amount of backwards motion of the projectile in `test_conservation`? Is it due to friction?
